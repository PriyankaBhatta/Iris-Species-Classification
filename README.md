# Iris-Species-Classification
Iris dataset is the Hello World for the Data Science, so if you have started your career in Data Science and Machine Learning you will be practicing basic ML algorithms on this famous dataset. Iris dataset contains five columns such as Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width and Species Type.

Iris is a flowering plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded digitally

The iris dataset contains the following data

a. 50 samples of 3 different species of iris (150 samples total)

b. There are 50 observations of each species for a total of 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

Measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

The format for the data: (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)

The 4 features are

- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm

The target class The flower species type is the target class and it having 3 types:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica
